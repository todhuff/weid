Changelog:

0.1 First working version
0.2 Added date / time display
0.3 Make sure we don't crash due to network issues. / Convert to urllib2
0.4 Generalized URLs, can now specify URL per camera.
0.5 Added basic HTTP authentication, for passworded cameras.
0.6 Configuration files are now located in /etc/weid/ and named 'options'
    and 'cameras'. Sample config files are included, and need to be copied
    over manually.
0.7 Added some open web cameras to the config for testing. Added image
    scaling. ConfigObj boolean values elude me, so I added a str2bool()
    function to convert values from the config to actual bools.
    Now handles multiple camera types.
0.8 Simple camera layout has been partially implimented.
0.9 Multiprocessing is now functional. Current version uses shared
    namespaces, am considering rewriting to use pipes.
