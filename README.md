#weid
A simple program to display security cameras, written in python.

## Depends:
Python 2.x, python-configobj, fonts-droid, other stuff.

## Overview
Weid is a relatively simple program to display IP cameras.
It was written to run on a Raspberry Pi driving an HDMI monitor.

I couldn't find anything to do what I wanted, so I wrote it myself.

The code is ugly. I didn't know python when I started, but pygame looked
like it had (almost) everything I needed, so I ran with it. This is the result.

When the program runs directly from the console (without X), it needs to
be run as root.

Running under X requires no special permissions, though you
will need at least read access to /etc/weid/ (and any files therein).

## Installation
By hand, for now.

## Configuring
Use the source, Luke!
